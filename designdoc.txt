Description
*******************
This game is a side scrolling shooter/platformer. The game is a classic MetroidVania with some variance.
The game is played by navigating through the levels while defeating enemies and picking up powerups along the way. The game 
is completed by reaching the final level and beating the final boss. 

*******************
Game Objects
*******************
The game initially takes place in the future, but the character will travel through time visiting different places. The settings
for the levels will vary by time and location, and each may have it's own distinctive art style. The player can run to the left or the 
right, as well as jump up to higher platforms in the level. A level will be one large room, with the screen focused on the player and
scrolling along with his/her movement. Enemies spawn in predetermined locations, and become "active" when the player comes close 
enough. Different enemies will have different attacks (melee/ranged, guns, swords, bows, cannons etc depending on the level). By 
destroying enemies, the player can pick up droppable objects that increase the player's current weapon's abilities (allowing their
current weapon to level up). If a player is hit, they receive a penalty of a decrease in their weapon level, as well as their life 
points. By destroying different bosses, players can also accumulate special items that can be used to enchance their weapon depending
on the boss that dropped it.

*******************
Sounds
*******************
There are sounds for the usage of different weapons, as well as sounds for picking up items, health, defeating enemies/bosses.
There will also be some background music that varies depending on the level. 

*******************
Controls
*******************
The player controls their character with the arrow keys. The player uses their weapons with "X", jumps with "Z", switches weapons
with "A", "S", "D", "C". Weapon switching can be done on the fly, and complex moves can be pulled off by chaining weapon switches.

*******************
Game flow
*******************
The player starts the game with 5 health. Health can be upgraded by collecting powerups. There will not be a tutorial, only a message
displaying the controls. The player has only one life, but there are many save points scattered and the player can heal at save points.
Pressing <ESC> will bring up the menu, allowing a player to reset the game or exit.

*******************
Levels
*******************
There will be multiple levels, each with a different theme for visuals and enemy types. Each level will have different enemies 
specific to that level, and a final boss that rests at the end of the level. Levels are advanced by killing the level boss.
